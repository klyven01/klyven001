        <p>
          Because every {config.BRAND_NAME} piece is made to order through print-on-demand, we
          have a more limited returns window than a standard retailer — please read this policy
          before ordering.
        </p>

        <Section title="Return Window">
          {`You can request a size exchange or return within ${config.RETURN_DAYS} day${config.RETURN_DAYS === 1 ? '' : 's'} of delivery. Requests made after this window can't be accepted.`}
        </Section>

        <Section title="Eligibility Conditions">
          To qualify for a return or exchange, the item must be:
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>Unworn and unwashed</li>
            <li>In original condition with all tags attached</li>
            <li>Reported within the return window above, with photos if damaged/defective</li>
          </ul>
        </Section>

        <Section title="Non-Returnable Cases">
          Because items are produced specifically for your order, we can't accept returns for
          change of mind, an incorrect size selected at checkout, or normal wear and tear.
        </Section>

        <Section title="Damaged or Incorrect Items">
          If your order arrives damaged, defective, or different from what you ordered, contact us
          within the return window with photos of the issue and we'll arrange a replacement or refund
          at no extra cost to you.
        </Section>

        <Section title="How to Start a Return">
          Email {config.SUPPORT_EMAIL} with your Order ID, the reason for the return, and photos if
          relevant. We'll confirm eligibility and next steps within 1–2 business days.
        </Section>

        <Section title="Order Cancellations">
          You can cancel an order free of charge as long as it hasn't yet entered production —
          usually within a few hours of placing it. Once an order has moved to "Processing" or
          later, it can no longer be cancelled since production has started. To request a
          cancellation, email {config.SUPPORT_EMAIL} with your Order ID immediately after ordering.
        </Section>

        <Section title="Refund Timeline">
          Approved refunds are processed to your original payment method within 5–7 business days
          of approval. Cash on Delivery orders are refunded via bank transfer or UPI.
        </Section>
